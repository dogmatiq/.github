# Contributing

The **Dogmatiq** organization maintains open source software; contributions from
the community are encouraged and very much appreciated. Please take a moment to
read these guidelines before submitting changes.

Contributions to our projects are released under the MIT license, unless
stated otherwise by the project's LICENSE file.

## Building and testing

With few exceptions, all of our repositories include a Makefile designed for use
with GNU make. Running `make` with no arguments always runs the tests.

## Submitting a pull request

Before submitting your pull request, please open a GitHub issue on the relevant
project to discuss the change you'd like to make. If there is an existing issue
please discuss the changes there to clarify the approach that should be taken.

Some further actions you can take that will increase the likelihood of your pull
request being accepted include:

- Mimicking the code style and quality of the project.
- Including unit tests. Use the existing tools used throughout the project.
- Submit small, focussed PRs. If you have multiple unrelated changes please
  submit them as separate PRs. Avoid correcting unrelated typos and code style
  violations within more substantial PRs.
- Write [good commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- Adding any substantial API or behavioral changes to CHANGELOG.md under an
  `[Unreleased]` heading at the top of the file.
