We build [Dogma], an open-source toolkit for developing message-based and
distributed applications in [Go] with a focus on the tenets of [Domain Driven
Design].

We've also open-sourced a number of libraries and tools that we developed for
use in our own projects; hopefully they'll be useful to you too.
