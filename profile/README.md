We build [Dogma], an open-source toolkit for developing message-based and
distributed applications in [Go], with a focus on the tenets of [Domain Driven
Design].

Along the way we've built a number of libraries and tools for use in our own
projects. We have published them here in the hope that they will be useful to
the community at large.
